Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas. It was alleged of unethical and fraudulent behavior and the story ends with the bankruptcy of one of America's largest corporations. The problem statement here was to mine through the its emails dataset and leverage the insights from the data to some meaningful conclusions. We used a two-pronged approach â€“ Network Based Analysis and Natural Language Processing to identify Enron employees who were potentially indulgent in fraudulent or unethical behavior. The network analysis identified a small network of individuals who showed suspicious behavior and NLP unearthed that their emails indeed contained numerous semantic indications of unethical behavior.
